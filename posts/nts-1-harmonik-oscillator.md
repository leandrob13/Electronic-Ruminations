Since I already explored subharmonic sound generation related to the [undertone series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertone_series) and in the process programmed the [Subharmonikorg](/posts/subharmonikorg-subharmonic-oscillators-for-the-korg-nts-1), a subharmonic oscillator for the nts-1, 
it was time to look into the [overtone series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(music)). Also known as the harmonic series, the overtones series is generated by multiplying the fundamental frequency by a series of integer numbers in order to create harmonic relationships from the root note.
Looking into the eurorack synth world, I came across the [Verbos Electronics Harmonic Oscillator](http://www.verboselectronics.com/modules/harmonic-oscillator) which has an architecture of one main oscillator and seven harmonic oscillators. 
Each harmonic oscillator multiplies the main frequency by its ordered number and has faders that allow the user to set the amplitude of the waves that are going to be added to the fundamental.
The Verbos has more features but I decided to adopt the basic architecture limited to only four harmonics and just for the fun of it, add a wavefolder.

I made a post discussing [the principles of creating complex wave forms from adding harmonic sine waves to the fundamental frequency wave](https://leandrob13.github.io/Electronic-Ruminations/posts/music-synthesis-wave-creation-with-python/). It is explained step by step in a python jupyter notebook.
Based on those principles, we will be able to compose several harmonic related sine waves and combine them to get interesting timbres.
